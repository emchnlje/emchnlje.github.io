description: Earthâ€™s original evil empire teleported off-planet after a defeat by rebels 10,000 years ago. Phoenix earth agents, recruited and guided by intergalactic telepathy, devise a Phoenix invasion conspiracy. Their scientists will regain access to their alien tech database hidden on earth while Phoenix leaders turn earth into a slave labor colony. A female forensic lab specialist and the matronly leader of a Langley think tank have close encounters with Phoenix assassins. They join with CIA agents and two WW2 veterans who thwarted Phoenix plans 60 years earlier. They form the last line of defense in an earth-verses-aliens confrontation that plays out below the radar of global news and governments.
