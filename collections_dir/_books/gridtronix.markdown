    GridTronix, book three of the Phoenix Apocalypse Series, occurs 100 years after book two, Phoenix Weather War. A Russian billionaire conspires with a Chinese scientist to mentally entrain the World Trade Commission into accepting the GridTronics Corporation as the sole provider of global wireless power. They claim their network of GridTronix machines amplifies power produced by earth's grid of ley lines for pennies on the dollar with zero environmental impact.
    <br><br>
    However, their network will power and focus a teleportation beam from the Phoenix planet to the restored Tower of Babel, the scene of an invasion attempt 6,500 years ago. Part of that beam will shunt to a second device hidden in Havana. The Midwest Alliance must defend against mental entrainment and superior off-world technology to fight the Phoenix invasion fleet in the Mediterranean and in Cuba.
