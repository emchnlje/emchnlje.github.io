    Phoenix Weather War, the second book in the series, occurs three hundred years after book 1, Phoenix Database. Earth’s original evil empire makes a new attempt to return to earth by secretly using a Russian weather control network to align and strengthen earth’s ley line grid. This will power and aim their teleportation device on the Phoenix planet.
    <br><br>
    Rebels on the Phoenix planet align with American members of the Doomsday Survival Network, descended from characters in book 1. We hope to prevent invasion and the rebels wish to destroy the Phoenix elitist government. Invasion ships are on the transport pad as the High Ruler enters the launch code. The High Ruler is invincible, and the invasion seems inevitable. Teleportation time is eight minutes.
